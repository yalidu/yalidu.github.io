COMP0124: Multi-agent Artificial Intellgience

An introduction of multi-agent machine learning, a subfield of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Multi-agent learning arises in a variety of domains where multiple intelligent computerised agents interact not only with the environment but also with each other. There are an increasing number of applications ranging from controlling a group of autonomous vehicles/drones to coordinating collaborative bots in factories and warehouses, optimising distributed sensor networks/traffic, and machine bidding in competitive e-commerce and financial markets, just to name a few. The module combines the study of machine learning with that of game theory and economics, including topics such as game theory, auction theory, algorithmic mechanism design, multi-agent (deep) reinforcement learning. Practical applications, including online advertising, online auction, adversarial training for generative models, bots planning, and AI agents playing online games, will also be covered and discussed.
