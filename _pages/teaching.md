## Teaching

### 2022/2023

* [ Decision Structure in Decentralized Multi-Agent Learning](https://www.oxfordml.school/) <br>
This talk discusses factorizability of multi-agent systems including the transition dynamics and action coordinations. We discusse the proposed scalable model-based RL in networked systems.
