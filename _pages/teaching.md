<!--

with Joel Z. Leibo (DeepMind)
invited by [Dr. Liang Zheng](https://zheng-lab.cecs.anu.edu.au/)
An introduction to optimisation methods in machine learning. <br>

This talk discusses factorizability of multi-agent systems including the transition dynamics and action coordinations. We discusse the proposed scalable model-based RL in networked systems. <br>
