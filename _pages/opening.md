I am always looking for PhD students and postdocs to work with me on reinforcement learning and multi-agent learning. Topics interested include multi-agent cooperation/coordination, policy generalization/evaluation, social aspects of learning agents (e.g. explainability, etihcs, fairness),and industrial applications. We, the Multi-agent Learning Group, provide a collaborative, open and inclusive environment for research and learning.
