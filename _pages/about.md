# About Me

I am currently an Assistant Professor (UK Lecturer) at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) and a member of [Distributed Artificial Intelligence Group](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/dai).
Prior to joining King's, I was a postdoc researcher at Centre for AI, [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/ai-centre/) working with [Prof. Jun Wang](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/Jun.Wang/).
I received my PhD from University of Technology Sydney in 2019, advised by [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwlJNLcAAAAJ&hl=en).
My research interest lies in machine learning and reinforcement learning, especially in the topics of multi-agent learning, policy evaluation, social agents, and applications to Game AI and data science.

* I am actively looking for [PhD students](opening.md) and [postdocs](opening.md) to work with me. Check [Openings](opening.md) for funding opportunities and topics of interest. Please drop me an email with your CV and interest.
* I am happy to host (remote) undergraduate / graduate visitors and supervise summer research projects. Please drop me an email with your CV and interest.
* For [Master's]() and [undergrad’s project]() at [King’s](), please contact me before putting me forward as the supervisor.
