I am currently an Assistant Professor (UK Lecturer) at [King's College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/).
I lead the [Cooperative AI Lab](https://coopai.kcl.ac.uk/).
My research interests lie in reinforcement learning and multi-agent cooperation, with a focus on topics such as generalization, zero-shot coordination, evaluation of human and AI players, and social agency (e.g., human-involved learning, safety, and ethics), among others.
