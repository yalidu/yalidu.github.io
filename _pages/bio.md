Previously, I received my PhD degree from University of Technology Sydney in 2019 supervised by [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwlJNLcAAAAJ&hl=en). 
I am fortunate to have worked with [Prof. Tong Zhang](http://tongzhang-ml.org/), [Dr. Lei Han](https://leihan.org/) and [Prof. Ji Liu](http://jiliu-ml.org/).
